A little About Me:: Im 22 ♓️. I graduated with an Associate in Graphic Design and am working towards my Bachelors's in Computer Science.
I love to travel when I can and be outdoors. The South of France is the end goal. (Planning incredibly in advance but a girl can dream right...) I've never been able to stick to one thing so if settled on just doing it all. 


Proficient In These Areas ===
